# Verification record

Engine: Godot **4.6.3.stable.official.7d41c59c4**, Linux cloud environment.

## Visual milestone: Cedar Grove Ballpark

This pass preserves M1–M3 mechanics and adds a warm teal/cream/gold art direction, a decorative infield island, textured dirt, open dugouts, covered seating, a detailed workshop, local sponsor signs, a larger scoreboard, concourse props, and a surrounding tree line. The mower and character visuals now live separately from their controllers. The player has a procedural walk cycle and the mower shows a seated driver. The HUD is separate from game coordination.

## Executed

- Headless editor import and script registration completed without parse errors. The final import ran outside the sandbox's editor-socket restriction.
- Headless main scene launch for 180 frames passed.
- `test_mowing.gd`: **14 passed assertions**, covering coordinate mapping, valid grass, dirt/mound and warning-track exclusion, diagonal sweep, broad deck footprint, outside-footprint preservation, unique overlap accounting, percentage, occupancy, and exit guards.
- `test_gameplay.gd`: **13 passed assertions**, covering grounded player/mower, entering, accelerating, real cutting while driving, moving exit guard, stopping/exiting, session persistence, safe grounded exit, reverse steering, and stopping at the workshop wall.
- `test_visual.gd`: scripted graphical run under Xorg dummy and Mesa llvmpipe OpenGL Compatibility, with 4× MSAA. Inspected spawn, turning mowing pass, overview, workshop, grandstand, and mower detail captures. The driving pass still cut **839 unique cells (1.37%)**. Grass tufts disappear where the mask is cut, and the HUD uses the same tracked-cell percentage.
- Visual inspection corrected excessive workshop trim, sign readability, dark grass-tuft shading, and the seated arm/leg orientation. The warning track and infield do not require overlapping broad field layers.
- Repeated seat meshes use MultiMesh batches; 28,000 sparse grass tufts share one MultiMesh and the existing state texture. Solid color materials are shared. These are structural performance improvements, not a measured frame-rate guarantee.

The virtual display reports unsupported V-Sync; it does not affect the logic checks. Screenshots in `docs/screenshots/` are actual software-rendered game captures, not concept art. `test_visual.gd` can regenerate the six Linux captures in `/tmp/firstpitch-*.png`.

## M4: First infield drag tool

The first M4 slice adds a visible service rack, Q equipment swapping on foot beside a stopped tractor near the bay, R lift/lower controls, a 4 m/s working speed, and a mask-driven dirt-preparation objective. Mowing and dirt progress persist independently within the running session. The condition material is bound to the existing diamond and home-area meshes, avoiding overlapping dirt geometry.

- Existing mowing and tractor suites: **27 assertions passed** after M4 integration.
- `test_infield.gd`: **16 assertions passed** for coordinate mapping, workable basepaths, protected lawn/mound/bases/plate/track, oriented rectangular width and depth, diagonal sweeps, overlap-safe accounting, non-dirt exclusion, and percentage math.
- `test_drag_gameplay.gd`: **22 assertions passed** for Q/R key handling, bay-only tool swapping, rack/deck state, objective selection, raised/moving guards, actual forward preparation, working-speed limit, task separation on untouched grass, raising while moving, reverse travel over untouched dirt, exiting, persistence, and returning to mowing.
- Total: **65 passing assertions**, with no failed or skipped assertions.
- `test_drag_visual.gd`: scripted graphical comparison of the same basepath before and after a controlled forward pass. The pass prepared **807 cells (6.40%)** while mowing remained **0.00%**. Inspected the tool bay and lowered drag up close; a fine-grooved, lighter strip follows the mesh attachment. Captures are `tool-bay.png`, `dirt-before.png`, `dirt-after.png`, and `dragging.png` under `docs/screenshots/`.

The dragging graphical test explicitly repositions the tractor at a basepath start for a repeatable comparison. It is not a human-driven route from the workshop. The attachment follows tractor heading rigidly and has no independent trailer collision or suspension. Lowered reverse travel does not prepare dirt. Chalk, bases, and the pitcher/batter work areas are not erased or repaired by this first tool.

## Not established

This was scripted graphical validation, not a human keyboard/mouse playtest. Native Windows execution of these updates, Forward+ appearance on a hardware GPU, sustained frame-rate targets, and a full 100% field mow were not tested here. The user confirmed the original version's mechanics in a local playtest; that does not establish validation of this update. No Windows export template or executable is included.

The art is still generated prototype geometry. The uncut tufts are sparse, not a dense lawn simulation. They shrink away beyond 38 m and cast no shadows. Set `tuft_count` to zero for a cheaper visual configuration without changing scoring. The infield lawn is decorative and excluded from the outfield objective.

## Manual acceptance checklist

1. Pull `main`, import project.godot in Godot 4.6.3 or newer stable 4.x, and press F5.
2. Walk, sprint, jump, orbit and zoom near the workshop. Check the walk cycle and camera obstruction.
3. Approach the mower, press E, drive forward, reverse, turn and brake. Check that the seated driver appears and E refuses a moving exit.
4. Cross fair grass horizontally and diagonally. Check deck-width stripes, disappearing tufts, persistent overlap, and increasing percentage.
5. Drive over dirt, the decorative infield lawn, and warning track. Percentage must remain unchanged.
6. Stop, exit, walk around the cut path, re-enter and continue. Try exiting near obstacles.
7. Check the workshop, open dugouts, signs, scoreboard, stands, and tree line at player height.
8. Near the parked tractor, press Q on foot to equip the drag. Confirm the unused deck appears on the bay rack.
9. Enter, drive to a basepath, stop, and press R to lower. Drive forward and check the visible smooth strip and dirt percentage. The outfield percentage must stay unchanged.
10. Raise the drag while moving, then stop, lower it, and reverse over new rough dirt. Progress must not increase. Grass, bases, plate/batter area, and the mound must not count.
11. Stop, exit, and inspect the path. Return to the workshop, swap back to mowing with Q, and confirm both progress values remain.
12. Check Forward+ appearance and performance on the target Windows GPU before expanding the tool suite.
