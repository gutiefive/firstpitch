# Verification record

Engine: Godot **4.6.3.stable.official.7d41c59c4**, Linux cloud environment.

## Visual milestone: Cedar Grove Ballpark

This pass preserves M1–M3 mechanics and adds a warm teal/cream/gold art direction, a decorative infield island, textured dirt, open dugouts, covered seating, a detailed workshop, local sponsor signs, a larger scoreboard, concourse props, and a surrounding tree line. The mower and character visuals now live separately from their controllers. The player has a procedural walk cycle and the mower shows a seated driver. The HUD is separate from game coordination.

## Executed

- Headless editor import and script registration completed without parse errors. The final import ran outside the sandbox's editor-socket restriction.
- Headless main scene launch for 180 frames passed.
- `test_mowing.gd`: **14 passed assertions**, covering coordinate mapping, valid grass, dirt/mound and warning-track exclusion, diagonal sweep, broad deck footprint, outside-footprint preservation, unique overlap accounting, percentage, occupancy, and exit guards.
- `test_gameplay.gd`: **13 passed assertions**, covering grounded player/mower, entering, accelerating, real cutting while driving, moving exit guard, stopping/exiting, session persistence, safe grounded exit, reverse steering, and stopping at the workshop wall.
- `test_visual.gd`: scripted graphical run under Xorg dummy and Mesa llvmpipe OpenGL Compatibility, with 4× MSAA. Inspected spawn, turning mowing pass, overview, workshop, grandstand, and mower detail captures. The driving pass still cut **839 unique cells (1.37%)**. Grass tufts disappear where the mask is cut, and the HUD uses the same tracked-cell percentage.
- Visual inspection corrected excessive workshop trim, sign readability, dark grass-tuft shading, and the seated arm/leg orientation. The warning track and infield do not require overlapping broad field layers.
- Repeated seat meshes use MultiMesh batches; 28,000 sparse grass tufts share one MultiMesh and the existing state texture. Solid color materials are shared. These are structural performance improvements, not a measured frame-rate guarantee.

The virtual display reports unsupported V-Sync; it does not affect the logic checks. Screenshots in `docs/screenshots/` are actual software-rendered game captures, not concept art. `test_visual.gd` can regenerate the six Linux captures in `/tmp/firstpitch-*.png`.

## Not established

This was scripted graphical validation, not a human keyboard/mouse playtest. Native Windows execution of this visual update, Forward+ appearance on a hardware GPU, sustained frame-rate targets, and a full 100% field mow were not tested here. The user confirmed the original version's mechanics in a local playtest; that does not establish validation of this update. No Windows export template or executable is included.

The art is still generated prototype geometry. The uncut tufts are sparse, not a dense lawn simulation. They shrink away beyond 38 m and cast no shadows. Set `tuft_count` to zero for a cheaper visual configuration without changing scoring. The infield lawn is decorative and excluded from the outfield objective.

## Manual acceptance checklist

1. Pull `main`, import project.godot in Godot 4.6.3 or newer stable 4.x, and press F5.
2. Walk, sprint, jump, orbit and zoom near the workshop. Check the walk cycle and camera obstruction.
3. Approach the mower, press E, drive forward, reverse, turn and brake. Check that the seated driver appears and E refuses a moving exit.
4. Cross fair grass horizontally and diagonally. Check deck-width stripes, disappearing tufts, persistent overlap, and increasing percentage.
5. Drive over dirt, the decorative infield lawn, and warning track. Percentage must remain unchanged.
6. Stop, exit, walk around the cut path, re-enter and continue. Try exiting near obstacles.
7. Check the workshop, open dugouts, signs, scoreboard, stands, and tree line at player height.
8. Check Forward+ lighting and frame rate on the target Windows GPU before moving to M4.
